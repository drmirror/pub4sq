This is a simple PHP script that displays your last few Foursquare
checkins on a Google map.  Simply insert your Foursquare RSS feed at the
indicated location in the file, place the file in a directory
accessible by your web server, and you're done.

I wrote this as a replacement for the Google Latitude Public Location
Badge.  There's also a short blogpost about it.
