This is a simple PHP script that displays your last few Foursquare
checkins on a Google map. Generate a Foursquare oauth token and insert 
it at the indicated location in the file, place the file in a directory
accessible by your web server, and you're done.

I wrote this as a replacement for the Google Latitude Public Location
Badge.  There's also a [blog
post](http://drmirror.net/2013/09/04/my-current-position/) about it.
